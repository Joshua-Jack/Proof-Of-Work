### Overview
The Momint Marketplace System is a solution for trading Real World Assets (RWA) tokens. It consists of the following three main components:

## **ERC1155 RWA Token Contract**
The ERC1155RWA contract is desinged for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) with built-in royalty support. This contract enables efficient multi-asset management while ensuring royalty distribution.

## **Key Features**
- **Multi-Token Support**: One contract can manage multiple asset types.
- **Royalty Mechanism**: Integrates ERC-2981 for royalty management.
- **Upgradeable Design**: Ensures future-proofing and contract enhancements.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Provides secure function calling.
- **Pausable Functionality**: Enables emergency stop mechanisms.
- **Supply Tracking**: Keeps record of token issuance.

## **Minting Tokens**
To mint a new token:
```solidity
mint(
    uint256 amount,
    string memory uri,
    address[] memory royaltyRecipients,
    uint256[] memory shares
);
```
- Creates a new token with unique metadata and tokenId.
- Assigns royalties to specified recipients.
- Defines royalty share percentages.

## **Batch Operations**
The contract also supports batch operations:
```solidity
batchMint();
```
- Allows multiple tokens to be minted in a single transaction.
- Reduces gas costs and improves scalability.

## **Security Considerations**
### **Access Control**
- Only authorized users can mint tokens.
- Admins have control over fee configurations.
- Only accepted payment tokens are allowed to be used as the buy token.

### **Safety Mechanisms**
- Emergency stop functionality.
- Reentrancy protection to prevent exploits.
- Non-Zero checks to ensure outcome is what we intend

## **RWA Royalty System**
The royalty system is designed for efficent payment distribution upon sales.

### **Royalty Configuration**
```solidity
struct RoyaltyInfo {
    address[] recipients;  // Royalty receivers
    uint256[] shares;      // Shares in basis points (1 BP = 0.01%)
}
```
- Total basis points = 10000 (100%).
- Example allocations:
  - 5% royalty = 500 basis points.
  - 2.5% royalty = 250 basis points.

### **Setting Royalties During Minting**
Example configuration for multiple recipients:
```solidity
address[] memory recipients = new address[](2);
recipients[0] = address1;
recipients[1] = address2;

uint256[] memory shares = new uint256[](2);
shares[0] = 500; // 5%
shares[1] = 300; // 3%

uint256 tokenId = rwaToken.mint(
    1000,           // Amount
    "ipfs://...",  // Metadata URI
    recipients,     // Recipients
    shares          // Shares
);
```

### **Updating Existing Royalties**
```solidity
function setRoyalties(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address[] memory recipients,
    uint256[] memory shares
) external;
```
- Allows modifications to royalty allocations.

## **Royalty Distribution Process**
### **1. Sale Price Calculation**
For a sale price of **100 USDT**, with:
- 5% primary royalty
- 3% secondary royalty
- 2.5% protocol fee

**Distribution:**
1. Protocol Fee: **2.5 USDT**
2. Primary Royalty: **5 USDT**
3. Secondary Royalty: **3 USDT**
4. Seller Receives: **89.5 USDT**

### **2. Payment Flow**
```solidity
function _handlePayment(
    uint256 listingId,
    uint256 amount,
    address buyer
) internal returns (uint256 totalPrice);
```
- Calculates total price.
- Deducts protocol fees.
- Distributes royalties before finalizing transaction and sending the seller the remaining assets.

## **Implementation Example**
Creating a new RWA token with royalties:
```solidity
function createTokenWithRoyalties() external {
    address[] memory recipients = new address[](3);
    recipients[0] = projectOwner;
    recipients[1] = artistAddress;
    recipients[2] = platformWallet;

    uint256[] memory shares = new uint256[](3);
    shares[0] = 500; // 5% to project owner
    shares[1] = 300; // 3% to artist
    shares[2] = 200; // 2% to platform

    uint256 tokenId = rwaToken.mint(
        initialSupply,
        metadataUri,
        recipients,
        shares
    );
}
```

## **Royalty Validation and Safety Checks**
1. **Array Consistency**: Recipients and shares arrays must match in length.
2. **Non-Zero Addresses**: Recipients cannot be the zero address.
3. **Total Shares Cap**: Cannot exceed 10000 (100%).
4. **Valid Share Values**: Each share must be greater than zero.

## **Querying Royalty Information**
To retrieve royalty details for a specific token and sale price:
```solidity
function getRoyaltyDetails(
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 salePrice
) external view returns (
    address[] memory recipients,
    uint256[] memory amounts
);
```
- Returns the recipients and their respective payout amounts.
- Helps marketplaces ensure proper royalty distribution.

## **Marketplace Contract**
Overview
The RWA Marketplace enables users to trade tokenized real-world assets seamlessly. It integrates directly with the ERC1155RWA token contract to ensure automated royalty distributions and supports various payment tokens for transactions.

## **Key Features**
- **Multi-Payment Support**: Accepts multiple ERC20 tokens for purchases (LISK, USDT, etc.).
- **Secure Escrow System**: Holds tokens in custody during active listings with automated return mechanisms.
- **Automated Fee Distribution**: Handles protocol fees and royalty payments with configurable fee structures.
- **Batch Operations**: Supports purchasing from multiple listings in one transaction for gas efficiency.
- **Emergency Controls**: Includes pause and emergency withdrawal functionality for risk management.
- **Listing Management**: Complete control over listing creation, cancellation, and updates.


## **Listing Structure**
Each listing in the marketplace is defined by the following structure to ensure proper listing managment:

seller: The address of the token owner initiating the sale.
tokenId: The unique identifier of the RWA token being listed.
amount: The number of tokens available for sale.
pricePerToken: The selling price for each token unit.
paymentToken: The type of payment token accepted (e.g., USDT, LISK).
active: Indicates whether the listing is currently active.

## **Creating a Listing**
To list RWA tokens for sale, the following function is used:

```solidity
function createListing(
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 pricePerToken,
    address paymentToken
) external;
```
Process:
- Token Transfer: Transfers the specified amount of tokens from the seller to the marketplace's custody.
- Listing Details: Sets all details needed for the listing structure.
- Unique ID Generation: Generates a unique identifier for the new listing.
- Active Listing: Listing becomes active and will be ready for purchases. 

## **Purchasing an RWA Share**
To purchase RWA tokens for sale, the following function is used:

```solidity 
 function buyTokens(
        uint256 listingId,
        uint256 amount
    ) external;
```
Process:
1. Validation:
- Confirms the listing is active.
- Verifies the amount of shares is available.
2. Payment Processing
  - Calculates and deducts protocol fees.
  - Distributes royalties to entitled recipients.
  - Transfers the remaining payment to the seller.
3. Token Transfer and Listing Updates
  - Transfers the purchased shares from the marketplace's custody to the buyer.
  - Adjusts the balance of shares for the RWA if applicable the listing will be set to deactive.
 
## **Canceling a Listing**
To cancel the listing of an RWA that is currently listed, the following function is used:

```solidity 
 function cancelListing(
        uint256 listingId
    ) external;
```
1. Validation:
 - Listing exists and is active
 - Caller is the original seller
2. State Updates
 - Marks listing as inactive
3. Token Transfer
  - Transfer tokens back to seller

 ## **Buy Multiple RWA'S from multiple listings**  
 To purchase multiple RWA's for sale, the following function is used:
```solidity 
 function batchBuyTokens(
        uint256[] calldata listingIds,
        uint256[] calldata amounts
    ) external;
```
The batch minting process mirrors the same process of purchasing from a single listing, with the main difference being that the system will handle multiple real-world assets (RWAs) the user intends to buy. All associated fees and royalties will be distributed as intended.
